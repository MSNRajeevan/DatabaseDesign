A Database Design Project that I worked on during my master's program.
As part of this project, we created a small-scale, non-trivial relational database similar to Goodreads by developing a logical design, implementing the physical design, populating the databases, and running CRUD operations. 
This repository has a backup for the schema, a query file we have used as a part of this project, a report of our whole project and an ERD of the schema.
